- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Riley!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software development, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Graphics Engine Design and a little tiny bit of web design if i'm feeling like it
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at VUW, specialising in cybersecurity. In my spare time I like to build weird physics engines and try and figure out different ways to make a 3D graphics engine with full phong shading and proper looking graphics run efficiently on my Intel Iris GPU (essentially how to build a efficient graphics engine so that my children might be able to one day play Subnautica on their Macbooks. Because right now I can't)
- ðŸ’¡ In my spare time I work as a lighting designer and production technician, so I rig, design and program lights and build stages and screen structures for everything from community theatre events to festivals like Homegrown. My favourite events to work are musicals and live music. The two times I feel happiest at the moment are when I am busking lights for a live band or when I have figured out some CS problem that has been evading me for a week. A bit cheesy I know.
