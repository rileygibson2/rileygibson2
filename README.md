- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Riley!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software development, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Graphics Engine Design and a little tiny bit of web design if i'm feeling like it.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at VUW, specialising in cybersecurity. In my spare time I like to build weird physics engines.
- ğŸ’¡ In my spare time I work as a lighting designer and production technician, so I rig, design and program lights and build stages and screen structures for everything from community theatre events to festivals like Homegrown.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ... my email is riley2.gibson2@gmail.com
